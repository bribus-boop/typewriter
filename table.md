An example of tables
====================

One of the first markup systems was a system called nroff, for the Unix system,
invented at Bell Labs.
nroff used 2-letter "dot commands" at the start of a new line to control formatting,
such as these:

| command | what it does                                      |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| .ti     | Add a *temporary indent* to the next line         |
| .sp     | Add a *blank line of space* between paragraphs    |
| .ll     | Set the *line length* for lines in a paragraph    |

Here's another example of a table: If you use the Linux command line, you may need
to use a feature called *regular expressions*. These are a powerful way to find
text with the **grep** command:

| character | what it means |
| :---: | --- |
| + | One or more of something |
| ? | Zero or more of something |
