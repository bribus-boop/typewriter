About carriage return and new line
==================================

Computers have different ways to represent text, but these days all computers
use an *encoding* system called **ASCII**, which stands for
**A**merican **S**tandard **C**ode for **I**nformation **I**nterchange.
Different computers track _line endings_ differently: 

- Linux and Mac use "new line"
- Older Macs use "carriage return"
- Windows uses both "carriage return" and "new line"

What is a "carriage return"?
----------------------------

On old-style typewriters, you loaded a sheet of paper by rolling around a
*roller*. This whole assembly would move left as you typed each letter.
Pressing a key caused a little arm with a letter stamp on the end
to strike the paper (through an inked ribbon) to make a letter.
The letter would always hit the center of the typewriter, and the roller
assembly moved by one letter, so that new letters appeared to the right.

When you hit the end of a line, you hit a lever that put the assembly
(called a *carriage*) back to the "home" position; this is called a
"carriage return."
The lever also had a little ratchet that advanced the roller by one
line height; this is called a "new line."

1. The lever returns the carriage
2. The ratchet makes a new line
3. You can type a new line

## A reminder about quotes

Quotes can be *inline* or *block*. In a paper, you might use an inline quote for a 
short quote from a source, like
"To be or not to be" (Shakespeare).
Or for a longer quote, you might use a block quote:

> I just many users complain if suddenly
